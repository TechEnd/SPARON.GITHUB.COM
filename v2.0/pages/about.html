<p>I'm SPARON, a 31-year old web developer and I love to create simple but useful web applications.</p>

<p>All my projects have a simple, yet elegant, design. I’m not a good designer and I therefore keep things deadly simple. Simple, but functional!</p>

<p>I believe that software should be open and freely distributable. Everyone should have the right to change it, adapt it and than redistribute it. That's why I publish all my projects to <a href='https://github.com/sparon'>Github</a>. Even <a href='https://github.com/sparon/sparon.github.io'>this website is open source</a>!</p>

<p>To prevent myself from getting bored, I’m always searching for the next challenge.</p>
